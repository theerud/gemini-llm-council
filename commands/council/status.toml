1.  **Retrieve Status**: Call the `council/get_council_status` tool.
2.  **Display Information**: Once you have the status, present it clearly:
    *   **Configuration File**: Absolute path to the config.
    *   **Status**: Does the file exist?
    *   **Council Members**: List the model IDs currently active.
    *   **Reasoning Effort**: Current default thinking depth (none, low, medium, high).

If no council is configured, strongly recommend running `/council:setup`.
